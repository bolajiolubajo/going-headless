# Purpose
This repository is created per discussion "Going Headless", which was a part of Imagine 2017 DevExchange sessions, to collect and discuss ideas regarding usage of Magento's Web API with custom frontend.
The Main goal of this project is to collect the most critical and painful points in Web API flows and development of a solution, which would satisfy most of the use cases.

# Workflow
Initially discussed workflow included commiting of all points as markdown files and using Github's comments to discuss. Please request write permissions for the repository or submit Pull Requests with proposals.
